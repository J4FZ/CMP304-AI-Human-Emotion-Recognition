# CMP304-AI-Human-Emotion-Recognition
Tensorflow &amp; Python code used to create a convolutional neural network for the use of human emotion recognition.

Requires images for each of the 7 emotions, place them in 'arranged_images' in relevant emotion folder.
'preprocessing.py' can the be run.

Once this is complete, 'train.py' can then be run.

To predict emotion from an image, run 'predict.py', giving the image as an argument. e.g. in console, run 'predict.py exampleimage.jpg'
